	<h1>Research activities</h1>


	<p>Starting October 1, 2020, I am pursuing a PhD at the Laboratory of Innovation in Surface Chemistry and Nanosciences (<a href="http://iramis.cea.fr/nimbe/licsen/">LICSEN</a>) which is part of a French public energy research institute called the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Alternative_Energies_and_Atomic_Energy_Commission">CEA</a>). The site is in Saclay, which is a few decaminutes south of Paris. Prior to my PhD I completed a Master's degree in Materials Physics in a joint program with the first year at Uppsala University and the second year at Campus Pierre et Marie Curie of Sorbonne Universit√© (Paris 6), with the <a href="http://master.physique.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/m2/smno/smno.html">SMNO/Nanomat program</a>. My Bachelor's degrees in Physics and Violin Performance are from Boston University.</p>

	<p>My research activities so far have focused on studying nanomaterials, specifically 2-dimensional (2D) materials.  Other types of nanomaterials include nanoparticles (0D) and nanowires (1D).  Such materials have one or more dimensions confined to the nanometer-scale.  The confinement effect gives rise to material properties which differ dramatically from the bulk (3D) counterpart, meaning that the nanomaterial version of a bulk material can be seen as a different material entirely.  One example of this is with graphene, which is one atomic layer of graphite, about 0.34 nm thick. In the below sections I elaborate on the nanomaterial research I have been involved with.</p>

        <h2>Raman spectroscopy of graphene</h2>

	<p>During my time at Boston University, I worked with my colleagues on novel techniques using Raman spectroscopy to probe charge density of graphene.  Our submission is currently in review, but the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04218">arXiv preprint</a> is available, titled <i>Ultra-low doping and local charge variation in graphene measured by Raman: experiment and simulation</i>.</p>
